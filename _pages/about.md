<p align="justify">
I am a Master's student at the <em>Robotics Perception &amp; Intelligence Lab (RPILab)</em>, 
<a href="https://www.sustech.edu.cn/">Southern University of Science and Technology</a>, 
advised by Professor 
<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=08U8joq2FOQC&hl=en&oi=ao">Jiankun Wang</a>. 
In 2024, I received my B.E. degree in robotics engineering from 
<a href="https://www.zjut.edu.cn/">Zhejiang University of Technology</a>, 
where I built the foundation for my studies in robotics. 
My research interests are in robot learning and robotics, with a current focus on learning-based robot visual navigation and human–robot collaboration.
