I am a Master's student at the [Robotics Perception and Intelligence Lab](https://robotics.sustech.edu.cn/ch/index.aspx), [Southern University of Science and Technology](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/), under the guidance of [Prof. Jiankun Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=08U8joq2FOQC&hl=en&oi=ao), starting from 2024. I received B.E. degree in robotics 
engineering from [Zhejiang Univerisity of Technology](https://www.zjut.edu.cn/), where I built the foundation for my robotics studies.

My research interests lie in leveraging robot learning methods to achieve more efficient and robust robot motion planning. Currently, I am focusing on tackling the challenge of enabling efficient and natural robot navigation behaviors in dense human crowds.
