I am a Master's student at the Robotics Perception and Intelligence Lab, Southern University of Science and Technology, under the guidance of [Prof. Jiankun Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=08U8joq2FOQC&hl=en&oi=ao), starting from 2024. My research interests lie in leveraging robot learning methods to achieve more efficient and robust robot motion planning. Currently, I am focusing on tackling the challenge of enabling efficient and natural robot navigation behaviors in dense human crowds.
